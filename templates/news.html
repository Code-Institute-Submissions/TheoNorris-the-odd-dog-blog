        Rachael Scdoris, a 28-year-old outdoors enthusiast, has been a
        competitive dogsled racer for well over a decade. Thanks to the National
        Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS), a
        division of the Library of Congress, she’s been an avid reader for the
        past year. Scdoris was born and raised in the wilderness of Bend, Ore.,
        where she traversed mountains and deserts on the back of a sled with her
        father, who spent 36 years as a musher—a trail his stubborn daughter was
        determined to follow no matter what. Scdoris was born with a rare vision
        disorder called congenital achromatopsia, robbing her of colors,
        distinct shapes and many layers of depth. But her flat, fuzzy world was
        more of a challenge for others and their misconceptions than for her. To
        the legally blind musher, a disability is a mere state of mind. “What it
        really boils down to is people saying ‘Well, if I were visually
        impaired, I couldn’t do it, so clearly you can’t.’” The 2003 decision to
        allow the teenage Scdoris to enter the Super Bowl of dogsled racing, the
        Iditarod, was “a major controversy.” She competed in the Iditarod three
        times after that—through blizzards and frost bite—before the word
        “gimmick” was finally laid to rest. Now, as a fully established racer,
        Scdoris is waiting on major sponsorships before undertaking the Alaskan
        legend again. In the meantime, Scdoris juggles a variety of
        balls—including training for her newest competitive interest, tandem
        cycling, giving commercial sled-dog tours and caring for more than one
        hundred huskies. That’s a kennel the size of a football field. In 2012,
        Scdoris was also a guest speaker at the national conference of libraries
        that partner with NLS to provide extensive reading materials in audio
        and braille to people with visual or physical disabilities. She first
        started receiving books through NLS programs as a child but didn’t use
        the service again until last year. “They told me about all this cool
        technology they’re using to make it easier for their patrons, and I
        really wanted to take advantage of that again,” said Scdoris, who favors
        authors like Paulo Coelho and Christopher Moore. “What takes most people
        20 minutes to read would take me an hour or more. To have the book on
        audio and be able to listen to it faster than most people could read
        it—that was a nice thing.” But, even when the self-proclaimed
        bleeding-heart liberal is enjoying political reads, her furry teammates
        aren’t far from her mind, “They’re amazing. The definition of teamwork
        is many individuals working toward a common goal. They’re all
        individuals but they become such a unit when it’s important. I’m kind of
        the leader, caretaker of that. I’ve been doing this my entire life, and
        I’ve tried to explain it my entire life, and I really can’t. It’s a
        feeling unlike any other.”

        If you’re hearing dogs talk to you, don’t panic. It may only be your
        e-mail. Petcentric.com, a Web site devoted to information and stories
        about pets, recently introduced a feature called “Doggie-Mail,” an
        interactive service that allows dog lovers to send free e-mail messages
        in the voice of their very own customized canine. When visitors log on
        to the site, they can choose one of three animated dogs to convey their
        message and then customize the character’s wardrobe, props and scene.
        They can choose to deck out their dog in a cowboy hat and dress shirt,
        or jazz up the pooch’s panache with a feather boa and sunglasses. They
        can then pick a variety of backdrops for the dog, including a dude ranch
        or a festive Hawaiian beach. After choosing a dog and customizing its
        outfit, users select a prerecorded message for the dog to speak, or type
        in their own message and choose a voice to accompany it. Petcentric.com
        also offers a toll-free number where users can record a message in their
        own voice. Once the e-mail has been customized, they can send the
        talking dog and its message to as many friends as they like. Visitors to
        the site can also watch clips of actor and author John O’Hurley reading
        excerpts from his new book “It’s Okay to Miss the Bed on the First Jump:
        And Other Life Lessons I Learned from Dogs.” “Dogs bring out a host of
        emotions in us,” said O’Hurley, “not the least of which is humor.” For
        more information or to start using Doggie-Mail, visit
        www.petcentric.com. The site also contains a gallery of pet photos
        submitted by subscribers, feature articles, product and book reviews and
        other pet-related content.

        Many older adults experience feelings of loneliness and isolation as
        they age, but pets can provide the companionship and love seniors
        desire. A new survey conducted by Home Instead, Inc., franchisor of the
        Home Instead Senior Care Network, found regular interaction with animals
        can help to reduce feelings of isolation and loneliness in older
        adults.The most frequently cited benefits of pet ownership are company,
        comfort, unconditional love, entertainment and improved mood. In fact,
        86 percent of pet owners agree they would be lonelier and less happy
        without their pet, and 58 percent agree that they would not be as
        physically healthy without their pet.The companionship and love provided
        by a pet can be especially meaningful for those most at risk for
        isolation. Home Instead found that pet owners who live alone are
        significantly more likely to report increased benefits of pet
        ownership.Owning a pet can also be an important factor for seniors
        deciding where they will live as they age. According to the survey, 82
        percent of older adults say they will not consider moving to a senior
        living community without their pet.While interaction with animals has
        been shown to improve mental and physical well-being in older adults,
        research from Home Instead confirms that seniors don’t need to own pets
        to experience the benefits. Those who regularly interact with, but don’t
        own, pets report feeling better just spending time with animals owned by
        family, friends and neighbors.There are many ways seniors can interact
        with animals without taking on the responsibility of pet ownership. Here
        are a few ideas:* Volunteer at a rescue organization or animal shelter.
        Many rescue organizations and animal shelters could use an extra hand.
        Seniors can help provide care for animals, including feeding, watering,
        restocking supplies, washing dishes, walking dogs, cleaning cages and
        enclosures or socializing with the animals. Volunteers experience the
        benefits of interacting with pets, and they can provide some care to an
        animal in need.* Get to know your neighbors’ pets. Seniors who regularly
        walk their neighborhoods will likely see pet owners walking their dogs.
        Asking to join them for a walk might lead to new friendships with
        neighbors and dogs.* Connect with a therapy animal. Pet Partners therapy
        teams, made up of a pet owner and his or her registered animal, go into
        many locations where seniors are living or being treated, such as
        hospitals, hospice centers and care communities.* Visit a pet store.
        Some pet stores sell small animals, such as guinea pigs, hamsters,
        chinchillas, gerbils, mice, rats, certain geckos, bearded dragons,
        snakes, and specific types of frogs, birds and fish. Visiting can
        provide a pet fix!With so many options available, finding the right
        animal interaction for each individual should be as easy as a walk in
        the dog park.To help older adults determine what type of pet interaction
        is right for them, the Home Instead Senior Care® network is offering
        free information and tips to help seniors incorporate animals into their
        lives. To learn more about how older adults can bring animals into their
        lives, visit PetsandSeniors.com or contact your local Home Instead
